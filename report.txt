Report on the AP3 Assignment

Mentry and Mlist are both done and working compiled in Windows, yet to try in VM.
Done dynamic hash table with the help of the use of stackoverflow and google, every man's best friend.

Initially was difficult due to no prior knowledge in C, had to slowly work and learn while doing.

Right now the only thing that is not implemented yet is when the name in the entry contains messages, the error 
control is not yet done for that, i commented some codes under ml_lookup and ml_add that checks for me and its
respective variables however i am not sure if it works yet.

Surname validation is done by checking whether there is a , or there is not, the checking whether there is spaces if
there is no comma.

hash table is recreated with size * 2 and rehashed and added to new table.

Memory leak not solved
